**Air Canvas** is an **air drawing application** that enables users to **draw in the air** using real-time **hand gesture recognition** powered by **computer vision** with **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **NumPy**. The application uses **Flask** for the web interface, allowing interaction through a browser.
